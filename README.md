## Deep Study in Famous Classical AI algorithms

This is the collection of Classical AI algorithms including
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-nearest-neighbor
4. Decision Treee
5. Gradient Boosting
6. Neural Network

In each notebook shows how each of them is constructed from scratch using only NumPy
